# PrimeCalculator


a calculator for prime based operations

at this point in time only one functionallity is fully functional, namely the prime factorizer.

it can factorize any positive integer up to and including 18.446.744.073.709.551.615
it can do this 1 one of 5 modes 0 -> no use a library, up until 4-> use of the large library.

the 4 libraries of primes are:
XS => the first 1000 
S  => the first 100000
M  => the first 1000000
L  => the first 10000000


roadmap:
fraction minimizer-> root minizer -> t.b.d.-> ui
